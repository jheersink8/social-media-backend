## Description
This tool provides the database backend for an eCommerce website. The database (called eCommerce_db) houses four tables:
-	Category (contains the high level category of each product the site sells)
-	Product (the actual product itself)
-	Tag (granular information about each product)
-	ProductTag (the through table that connects the many to many relationship of Product and Tag)

While there is no frontend for this tool, all the database functionality can be viewed through Insomnia (which is displayed in the demo video below). This tool demonstrates a working knowledge of the following tools:
-	PostgreSQL
-	Sequelize 
-	The use of .env files
-	Express.js
-	Node.js
-	Database entity relationships
-	Insomnia


## Installation 
Before using this application, install all the node modules, the database, and all the seed data by following the steps below: 
1.	Open a terminal that is running from the same folder as the server.js file
2.	Run the command (with no quotes) “psql -U postgres -f db/schema.sql”
3.	Enter the password “1234”
4.	Run the command “npm run seed”
5.	Run the command “node server.js” to sync Sequelize models to the DB


## Usage
Once the tool is invoked using the steps above, the user can view the routes using a tool like Insomnia. The routes that can be run with the JSON data (where relevant) is listed below:
